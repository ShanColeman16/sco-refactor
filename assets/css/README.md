# Shannon Coleman Horiseon Project

## Description of my project

I completed this project as a way to utalize the information I have learned so far. 

I built a website showcasing the different HTML syntax I have learned so far.

I was able to solve issues with the sizing of pictures. As well as fixing issues with links on the site that were not working. 

I learned that this is a trial and error class and I should not be afraid or frustrated if I do not understand things the first time.
